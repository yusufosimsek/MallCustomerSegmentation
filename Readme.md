# Mall Customer Segmentation  
### Exploratory Data Analysis, SQL Transformation & Inferential Statistics

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **analysis and segmentation of mall customers** using demographic and behavioral variables.  
The primary goal is to explore customer characteristics, identify meaningful segments, and evaluate group differences in spending behavior through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **inferential statistical methods**.

The workflow progresses from data preparation and visualization to hypothesis testing, ensuring both interpretability and statistical validity.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer-level information, including:

- Age  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  

These variables are used to analyze customer behavior and construct meaningful customer segments.

---

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis is conducted in the following stages:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Data cleaning and variable inspection  
- Transformation of continuous variables into categorical groups using SQL (`CASE WHEN`)  
- Creation of income and age segments for group-based analysis  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics  
- Distribution analysis  
- Visual exploration of spending behavior across demographic variables  

### 3. Segmentation
- Customers are segmented into **five groups** based on income and spending behavior  
- Segment characteristics are interpreted in terms of consumer behavior patterns  

### 4. Inferential Statistics
- Hypothesis formulation and testing  
- ANOVA and related statistical tests to compare group means  
- Evaluation of statistical assumptions and effect sizes  
- Interpretation of results with respect to customer segmentation

## Tools & Technologies

- **R**  
  - tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2)  
  - stats  
  - car  
- **SQL**  
  - Data transformation  
  - Conditional logic using `CASE WHEN`  
- **Markdown / Word**  
  - Reporting and documentation  

---

## Key Objectives

- Understand how **age and income groups differ in spending behavior**
- Assess whether categorical representations lead to meaningful group comparisons
- Apply inferential statistics to support data-driven conclusions
- Document the analytical reasoning and statistical results clearly

---

## Notes

This project emphasizes **methodological clarity** over model complexity.  
Categorical transformations are used intentionally to enable group-based inference rather than predictive optimization.
